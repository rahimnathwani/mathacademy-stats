   - **Generate Stats**: Opens a new tab with detailed statistics

## Statistics

The "Generate Stats" feature provides:

- **Percentiles**: Shows 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles for each course
- **Performance Metrics**: Percentage of activities achieving at least 1 XP per minute
- **Course Breakdown**: Separate statistics for each Math Academy course you've studied
